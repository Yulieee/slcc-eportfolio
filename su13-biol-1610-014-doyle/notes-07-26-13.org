- griffith: doing work with pneumonia
  -- smooth strain of bacteria, rough strain
  -- smooth - virulent, antibodies can't latch on
  -- rough - avirulent
  -- took heat killed smooth bacteria, injected into mice, and the mouse lived
  -- rough bacteria didn't kill the mice
  -- heat killed S + R would kill the mice, and live S bacteria could be cultured from the mice
  -- in the mice R bacteria converted over to S bacteria
  -- 1928?

- heat killed
- electrofloration: another way to kill cells

- another guy tried to figure out what component in the bacteria caused
  the transformation of the bacteria
  -- which guy?
  -- 1944

- aditional evidence on dna being genetic material came from study of
  viruses, and their genetic material
  -- viruphages
  -- phage

- experiment with virus dna
  -- radioactive sulfur to label protein
  -- radioactive phosphorus to label dna

- chargoff
  -- year?
  -- analyzed the base composition of dna
  -- TACG
  -- chargoff's rule, #A == #T && #C == #G

- watson & crick
  -- 1953
  -- discover the structure of dna

- measelson & stall
  -- 1958
  -- experiments to figure out which model of dna replication was
  correct
  -- 3 proposed models; conservative, semi conservative, dispersive models
  -- used N15, heavier nitrogen in bacteria

- helicase: unwinds dna at replication fork
  -- seperates the two parental strands
- single-strand binding proteins: stablizes dna to keep it single
  stranded, otherwise it would snap back together
- topoisomerase: enzymes to prevent tangled dna while it's being unwound
- primase


- okazaki fragment
