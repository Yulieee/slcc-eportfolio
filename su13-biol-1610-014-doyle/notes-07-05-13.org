- cell signaling
- protein kinase
- relay molecules in a signal transduction pathway
- in a phosphorilation pathway a series of proteins will get phosphated in turn
- when phosphated they are activated
- slightly different confirmation
- protein phosphatase, catalyzes the removal of the phosphate group
- goes from active to inactive
- 2% of ours are thought to be kinase's

- water soluble molecules
- 2 2nd messengers to remember (cyclic AMP, cAMP; Ca+2)
- many relay molecules are sensitive to the concentration of these 2nd messengers
- enzymes to remember: phosphofructokinase, ATP synthase, rubisco, pep carboxylase, gtpase, adenylyl cyclase
- adenylyl cyclase, converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP)
  -- in response to some kind of extracellular signal
  -- for example epinephrane

- g protein
- when adenylyl cyclase is activated it creates many cAMP
- later phospho diesterase, will convert cAMP to AMP

- cholera: the g-protein can get stuck on in some cases (bad water)
  -- the cholera toxin keeps the GTP from being hydrolized into GDP
  -- loss of water & salts from intestinal cells

- many signal molecules can increase the concentration of calcium ions
  -- Ca+2
  -- important second messenger

- skipping 11.13, 11.14

- transcription factors, turn genes on
  -- sometimes they can turn a gene off
  -- regulate gene expression
- mRNA
- ribosome

- sometimes transcription factors will work on several related genes
- pathways can amplify the response
  -- can also contribute to the specificity of the response
  -- hormone effect with epinephrane

- the final step activates an enzyme that breaks down glycogen
  -- glycogen phosphorilase
- epinephrane: fight or flight hormone
  -- glycogen will provide energy

- different kinds of cells have different collections of proteins

- scaffolding proteins, like a keyring ordering many different protein
  kinases in one place

- apoptosis: programmed cell death
  -- all cells have a built-in cell suicide system
  -- mandatory for development
  -- hypothermia as a treatment for severe heartattack, helps to prevent apoptosis

  - ch 9, 10, 11
  - test is monday-wednesday

* ch 12, the cell cycle

- 46 chromosomes
- chromotin
- each eukaryotic species has a charateristic numer of chromosomes
- gamines; egg & sperm
- all other cells are called somatic cells
- gamines have half the number of chromosomes

- haploid vs. diploid
  - diploid, 2 sets of the chromosomes

- in fertilization sperm and egg come together

- variation of the cell cycle that produces the gamines
  -- myosis
  -- only in the gonads, (testes, ovaries)
- mytosis, produces somatic cells
  -- copies
  -- division of the nucleus
  -- usually immediately followed by the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis)
- sister chromatids
  -- centromere
- cytokinesis: division of the cytoplasm

- mytotic phase, alternates with interphase in the cell cycle
  -- mitosis & cytokinesis
- interphase
  -- G_1, S (DNA synthesis), G_2
