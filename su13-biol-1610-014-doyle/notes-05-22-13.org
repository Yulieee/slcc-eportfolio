** properties of link

1. order (cells)
2. evolutionary adaptation: (camoflage) natural selection, traits, genetics
3. regulation: body temperature, blood sugar
4. energy processing: food, photosynthesis
5. reproduction
6. growth & development
7. response to an environment

- emergent properties

- cells
- organelles - sub-cellular stop
- reductionism: take it apart - dissecting
- systems biology: integration, emmergent properties
  -- model the dynamic behavior of biological systems

** cells

- heritable information
- DNA
- nucleotides
- genomes code for proteins
- proteins are built up of amino acids

- membrane

Eukaryotic & Prokaryotic

*** Eukaryotic

- membrane
- nucleus -> DNA
- cytoplasm
- organelles

*** Prokaryotic

- no nucleus
- dna w/out nucleus
- membrane


** feedback regulation

- enzymes (proteins):
- positive feedback: speed up a chemical reaction, catylize
- negative feedback: slow down a reaction
