* Ch 2

** covalent bonds

Covalent Bond: sharing of a pair of electrons

** molecular formulas

e.g.:

H_2 O
CH_4

** structural formulas

e.g.:

        H
        |
    H - C - H
        |
        H



      O = O


** bonds & valence

- binding capacity
- valence

- TODO learn/memorize bonding capacities of a bunch of elements
  O, Sulfer -> 2
  H -> 1
  C -> 4
  N -> 3
  Phosphorous -> 5


** polar / nonpolar

- a few atoms that are very electro-negative (O, N, Cl). They have a
  strong affinity for electrons. Like naughty kindergarteners they hog
  and don't share their toys (electrons). Polar bond
- if electrons are shared equally, we call it a nonpolar bond.
- carbon & hydrogen (Nonpolar)
- polar, if one element is bound to a more electro-negative element
- H_2 O -> polar covalent bond
- \delta^{-} => partial negative charge
- \delta^{+} => partial positive charge

** ionic bonds

- occur when an electron is stripped from an atom & transferred to
  another.
- usually occurs when an atom needs to lose an electron or two, and
  another needs to gain

- sodium : 3rd valence shell, 1 valence electron, likely to lose an
  electron in an ionic bond, leaving it with a positive charge. A sodium
  ion (Na^{+})
- chlorine: 17, 3rd valence, needs one to complete valence shell, likely
  to gain an electron, Cl^{-}
- sodium chloride: NaCl, would be a salt, doesn't have a covalent
  bond. forms a crystal in the absence of salt
- cations: positively charged ions
- anions: negatively charged ions

- Mg, magnesium. 2 valence electrons. Mg^{++}
- Cl, Cl^{-}
- MgCl_2, magnesium chloride
- ionic bonds are strong w/out the presence of water
- weak when in presence of water


** hydrogen bond (weak bond)

- Water (H_2 O) and Ammonia (N H_3)
- between (H_2 O) & (H_2 O)
- dotted line
- between polar bonded molecules

** van der walls connection

- methane (C H_4) nonpolar

- non polar bonds can have these
- electrons are not always symmetrically distrubuted in a
  molecule. allowing electrons to stick to each other even if it's only
  temporarily.

** weak bonds

- these bonds can form between 2 molecules, or even within a molecule

** molecule shape & function

- linear (2 atoms)
- shape forms when the orbitals rearrange
- tetrahedral shapes (methane), due to the S & P orbitals interacting
- biological molecules will interact with eachother based on the shape

** specificity

- endorphin
- morphine
- morphine mimics a part of the natural endorphin, sharing a similar
  shape. Allowing it to fit in a certain brain receptor


** chemical equations / reactions

- chemical reactions
- 2{H_2} + {O_2} -> 2{H_2 O}
- read the arrow (->) yields
- we're going to assume that our equations are balanced

- reactants --- reaction ---> product

- most reactions in biology are reversible
- <->
- back and forth, forever...
- sometimes reach equilibrium

*** reactant concentration

- billiard table w/ white: H, and red: O
- greater the concentration, the more frequently they'll collide & have
  a chance to form products.

** dynamic chemical equilibrium

- forward & reverse reaction occur at the same Rate
- still many reactions occurring (dynamic)
- at equilibium, no net change in concentration of reactants & products

** review

- valence electrons in common elements
- the elements that makeup 96% of living matter

* Ch 3 - water

- cells made up of a lot of water
- many unique properties
- lots of cohesion and adhesion
- high surface tension
- high specific heat
- high heat of vaporization
- expands as it freezes
- great solvent

- polarity!!
- partial negative on the H, and partial negative on the O
- polar covalent bond

** liquid state

- typically 4 partners
- hydrogen bonds about 1/20 as strong as a covalent bond

** cohesive behavior

- likes to stick to other water molecules due to the hydrogen bonds
- adhesion when molecules stick to other molecules
- polar molecules like other polar molecules; nonpolar likes nonpolar
- water likes paper towels (adhesion), means paper towels are positive charged
- wax paper nonpolar

** surface tension

- how difficult to stretch or break the surface
- hard to break surface of the water
- hydrogen bonds holding surface together
- ethyl alcohol, less surface tension, easier to belly flop (don't do this)
- ordered arrangement of the water molecules create surface tension

** moderates heat & temperature

- kinetic energy, anything that's moving
- atoms & molecules are always moving.
- molecules can absorb or lose energy
- molecules can absorb heat & speed up

- temperature is the measurement of the intensity of heat, due to the average
  kinetic energy of molecules

- water stabalizes air temperature
- acts like a heat bank
- affects weather patterns
- lake effect snow, and other effects due to large bodies of water

** heat

- measured in degrees celsius
- freezing point in celsius -> 0
- boiling point in C -> 100
- body temp C -> 37
- room temp C -> 23-24, 27

- calorie
- amount of heat energy to raise temp of 1g water 1 deg. c
- kilo calorie - 1000 calories, 1kg of water 1 degree
- kilo  calorie -> C -> capital C

** specific heat

- amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for to change degree
- water is a standard
- other substances usually have a lower specific heat
- ethyl alcohol .6 c specific degree
- iron: 1/10 the specific heat of water
- indicates how much a substance resists changing temperature
- water is resistive to this (hydrogen bonds)

- can also release a lot of heat when hydrogen bonds are broken

- organisms made mostly of water, therfore able to resist changes to
  temperature better

** evaporative cooling

- vaporization
- when molecules have enough kinetic energy to depart the liquid &
  become a gas
- can occur at room temperature (not too much)
- water + heat -> more vaporization
- heat of vaporization: amount heat a molecule absorbs to be converted
  int gas
- water has high heat of vaporization due to hydrogen bonds
- water heat of vaporization: 580 c per 1g water (high)
- steam has a whole lot of energy, so you can get badly burned

- only about half as much is needed to vaporize alcohol

- evaporation keeps us from overheating

** freezing

- water expands when frozen (hydrogen bonds)
- regular hydrogen bonds when frozen
- very organized & structured
- crystal lattice structure
- less dense when frozen
- stable hydrogen bonds
- liquid has unstable hydrogen bonds with molecules closer together

** solvent

- water is the solvent of life
- universal solvent
- a solvent dissolves substances
- a solution is a completely homogeneous mixture with a solvent and a sollute
- salt water: salt (sollute) + water (solvent)
- anything that dissolves in water will be polar or charged (salt, sugar)
- aqueus solution, a solution where water is the solvent
- good solvent because of it's polarity

- a compound can dissolve in water if it's polar or ionic
- sugar -> polar
- salt -> ionic

- even large protiens can dissolve in water if they have enough polar or
  ionic regions
- (amino acids build up protiens, peptides build up dna)

- nonpolar substances will not dissolve in water

- hydrophillic: water loving (salt, sugar, cotton, paper towel)
- hydrophobic: water fearing (oils, fats, wax, gasoline)

- cell membranes are nonpolar lipids (made out of a hydrophobic lipid)

** sollute concentration

- mix a known quantity of sollute & a known quantity of solvent
- moles:
- 1 mole: same number of molecules
- avogadro's number: 6.02e23

- must know the molecular mass to figure out the mole of a substance
- molecular mass or molecular Weight

- add up all the molecular mass of a molecule to know it's mole

- TODO masses to memorize
- hydrogen: 1
- carbon: 12
- nitrogen: 14
- oxygen: 16

- mass of water: H (1) + H (1) + O (16) = 18
- 1 mole of water = 18 AMU = 18 Dalton

- amu -> grams
- 18 g / mol

- methanol (kind of alcohol)
- C H_4 O

      H

(+ (* 6 12) (* 12 1) (* 6 16))
