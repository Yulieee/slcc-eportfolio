- mitosis
- cell division
- diploid 46 chromosomes
- gamines (sex cells) 23 chromosomes, haploid

** cell cycle
*** interphase
    - longest phase
    - cell is growing & developing

**** G_1

**** S (DNA synthesis)
     - DNA is being duplicated
     - sister chromatids
       -- 92 after S phase (why? 2 * 46 chromosomes)

**** G_2

*** mitotic phase

**** mitosis
    - division of the nucleus
    - 5 sub phases in mitosis

***** phases

****** pro-phases
       - chromatid condenses, and thickens into chromosomes
         -- 2 sister chromosomes held together by the centromere
       - nucleolus disappear
         -- have to stop making ribosomal rna, we're dividing the cell
       - in cytoplasm, microtubules spin
****** pro meta phase
       - looks like the nucleus has exploded
       - some microtubules of the spindle begin to interact with the chromosomes
       - each sister chromatid has a conneticore (connecticut?) at the region of the centromere
         -- where the microtubules attach
         -- connecticore microtubules
       - other microtubules overlap with eachother, and the connecticore
         microtubules to elongate the cell
         -- non cennecticore microtubules

****** meta phase
       - centrosomes are at opposite poles of the cell
       - stage in which all the chromosomes line up
       - meta phase plate
         -- imaginary line between the two poles of the cell

****** anna phase
       - shortest phase
       - the sister chromatids are going to seperate
       - connecticore microtubules begin to shorten, pulling apart the sister chromatids
       - the non-connecticore tubules are still pushing the poles apart
       - by the end, the two poles should have equal groups of
         chromosomes

****** t... phase (?)
       - daughter nuclei reform at the 2 poles
       - chromosomes are going to relax back into the chromatid
       - nucleolus is reformed
       - once nuclei are reformed, mitosis is complete


**** cytokinesis
    - without cytokinesis we would have a two nucleus cell
    - many cells don't continue to divide
      -- neurons, muscles, liver
      -- they may divide
      -- arrested in the G_0 phase
    - division of the cytoplasm
    - in animal cells we form a cleavage furrow
      -- made up of actin and myosin
      -- pinches the cytoplasm in half
