+5. two layers of phospholipids (with opposite orientations of the phospholipids in each layer) with each layer covered on the outside with proteins+

* 4. pre-test question 5

Which of the following statements about osmosis is correct?

+1. If a solution outside the cell is hypertonic compared to the cytoplasm, water will move into the cell by osmosis.+
*2. The presence of aquaporins (proteins that form water channels in the membrane) should speed up the process of osmosis.*
+3. If a cell is placed in an isotonic solution, more water will enter the cell than leaves the cell.+
+4. Osmotic movement of water into a cell would likely occur if the cell accumulates water from its environment.+
+5. Osmosis is the diffusion of water from a region of lower water concentration to a region of higher water concentration.+

* 5. pre-test question 6

In facilitated diffusion, what is the role of the transport protein?

+1. Transport proteins organize the phospholipids to allow the solute to cross the membrane.+
*2. Transport proteins provide a hydrophilic route for the solute to cross the membrane.*
+3. Transport proteins provide a low-resistance channel for water molecules to cross the membrane.+
+4. Transport proteins provide a protein site for ATP hydrolysis, which facilitates the movement of a solute across a membrane.+
+5. Transport proteins provide the energy for diffusion of the solute.+

* 6. pre-test question 9

Active and passive transport of solutes across a membrane typically differ in which of the following ways?

+1. Active transport is usually down the concentration gradient of the solute, whereas passive transport is always against the concentration gradient of the solute.+
*2. Active transport always involves the utilization of cellular energy, whereas passive transport does not require cellular energy.*
+3. Active transport is always faster than passive transport.+
+4. Active transport uses protein carriers, whereas passive transport uses carbohydrate carriers.+
+5. Active transport is used for ions, passive transport is used for uncharged solutes.+

* 7. pre-test question 10

Which of the following correctly describes some aspect of exocytosis or endocytosis?

*1. Exocytosis and endocytosis change the surface area of the plasma membrane.*
+2. Endocytosis and exocytosis involve active transport.+
+3. The inner surface of a transport vesicle that fuses with or buds from the plasma membrane is most closely related to the inner surface of the plasma membrane.+
+4. Both processes provide a mechanism for exchanging membrane-impermeable molecules between the organelles and the cytosol.+
+5. These two processes require the participation of mitochondria.+

* 8. question 1

In what way do the membranes of a eukaryotic cell vary?

+1. Phospholipids are found only in certain membranes.+
*2. Certain proteins are unique to each membrane.*
+3. Only certain membranes of the cell are selectively permeable.+
+4. Some membranes have hydrophobic surfaces exposed to the cytoplasm, while others have hydrophilic surfaces facing the cytoplasm.+
+5. Only certain membranes are constructed from amphipathic molecules.+

* 9. question 2

According to the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure, proteins of the membrane are mostly

+2. randomly oriented in the membrane, with no fixed inside-outside polarity.+
+3. free to depart from the fluid membrane and dissolve in the surrounding solution.+
+4. spread in a continuous layer over the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane.+
+5. confined to the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.+
