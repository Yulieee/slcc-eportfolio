*  ch 4: organic chemistry and carbon compounds

** reviewing chemical groups

*** -OH: Hydroxyl (alcohol)
*** C=O: Carbonyl (aldehyde & ketone)
*** OH-C=O: Carboxyl (carboxylic acid) often found in the ionized form
*** H-N-H (-NH_3): Amino
*** TODO

  H      H              O
   \     |            =
     N - C_\alpha - C
   /     |            \
  H      H              OH

*** Sulfhydral (thyl)

  sulfur similar binding capacity to oxygen

  R - S - H

  similar to hydroxyl

  disulfide bridge (covalent bond)

  R - S - S - R

*** Phosphate

organo phosphate if it's attached to some molecule containing carbon

P - 5 bonding capacity

          O
          ||
  R - O - P  - OH
          |
          OH

will probably be in the ionized form

          O

  R - O - P  - O^-   +  2H^+
          |
          O^-

ATP - adenosine tri-phosphate
ADP - adenosine di-phosphate
AMP

DNA has a sugar phosphate backbone

ATP transfers energy (look at ch.4 pre-test question 10)

Polar group

*** Methyl group

      H
      |
  R - C - H
      |
      H

  - CH_3

non-polar

will usually turn a gene off, though has been shown to turn some genes on


** ATP

   - Energy currency of the cell
   - adenosine tri-phosphate
   - one of the phosphate groups can split off and release energy giving us ADP
   - guanesine triphosphate is it's cousin, sometimes doing work in the cell


* ch 5

- macro molecule: a very large & complex moleculte that's made up of simpler sub-units

  -- carbohydrates
  -- proteins
  -- nucleic acids

- polymers: long molecule made up of many similar building blocks connected with covalent bonds
- monomers: the building blocks that make up a polymer

- example: train (polymer), train cars (monomers)

- We make polymers using dehydration reactions

- one momoner will lose a hydrogen, the other will lose a hydroxyl group

- hydrolosis reactions, breaking a dehydration created bond by adding water
- hydrolosis rx categorized by ennxymes

- polymers can have an inifinite amount of diversity
- proteins are built from 20 different monomers (amino acids)

- larger molecules have emergent properties


** carbohydrates

- sugars & it's polymers
- simple sugars monosaccharides
- complex sugars polysaccharides

*** sugars

**** hexose
- glucose is a hexose
  -- all sugars end in -ose
  -- carbonyl group & many hydroxyl groups
  -- aldose sugare (carbonyl group is an aldyhide)
- galactose (mirror image of glucose)
- fructose - keytose sugar (ketone aldyhide)

- sugars can differ in their skeletons from three to five carbons

- deoxyribose

- sugars can have an enantimer, must have an asymetric carbon atom
  -- glucose & galactose

- when sugars are in water, mostly they form a ring


- about half of the amino acids in our body are non-essential. Our body can form them and use glucose to form them
- many are essential and must come from our diet

- sacharides

*** disaccharides

- maltose = glucose + glucose
- sucrose = glucose + fructose


*** polysaccharides

- few hundred to a few thousand saccharides
- macro-molecules


- some are used to store energy (starch)
  -- starch is made by plants, many glucose monomers
  -- some starches are branched & others are not
  -- amylose (plant stockpiles of energy)
  -- amylopectin (similar to amylose, but branched)

  -- glycogen (animal starch)
     --- more branched than amylopectin
     --- stored in liver & muscles

- other polysaccharides are used for building material
  -- cellulose (major component of plants, used in cell walls)
  -- starch & glycogen use alpha glucose
     --- the hydroxyl is below the plane of the ring
  -- beta glucose used in cellulose
     --- hydroxyl is above the plane of the ring

- we can't digest cellulose
  -- no enzymes to break down beta glucose

- starch molecules are mostly helical (curvy)
- cellulose is always straight & never branched
  -- they can lie next to each other and hydrogen bond
  -- very strong
  -- fiber
- horses & cows do not have the enzymes to break the beta-glucose
  linkage, but they have micro organisms in their digestive track
  that can do this.

- kiten: structural polysaccharide
  -- othropods
  -- crusteaceans


** lipids

- too small to be classified as macromolecules
- do not form polymers
- hydrophobic / non-polar

- most are hydrocarbons

- fats contain glycerol & fatty acids
  -- glycerol (3 carbon alcohol) each carbon has a hydroxyl group
  -- fatty acids: long hydrocarbon chain with a carboxy group at one end (carbocylic acids)

- ester linkage: how the fatty acid links with the glycerol
  -- dehydration

- triacylglycerol: 3 ester linkages (lipid)
  -- don't want too much of this in our blood (we only want some)

- saturated fat: no double bonds in the fatty tail
  -- can rotate around bonds
  -- compact tightly
  -- typically solids at room temperature
  -- butter, margirine, cheese, fat in a steak

- unsaturated fat: double bond, bends
  -- oleic acid
  -- monounsaturated (one double bond) & polyunsaturated (many double bonds)
  -- can't rotate around the double bond
  -- can't pack together as tightly


- major function of fats is to store energy
- store twice as much energy as starch sacharides
- plants like to store unsaturated lipids
  -- oils
- animals like to store saturated fats
- fish oils are unsaturated


- phospho-lipid
  -- hydrophilic head & hydrophobic tails
  -- they will naturally associate with eachother to form a bilayer
     --- line up to have the fatty acid tails interact (hydrophobic)
     --- wall, cell membranes
     --- intracellular & extracellular

- steroids
  -- also lipids
  -- 4 fused carbon rings
  -- cholesterol, testosterone, and estradiol
  -- not present in plants

- cholesterol
  -- made in the liver & used to make other steroids in the body

** proteins

- first place (pro), make up 50% of the dry-weight of cells
- a human has tens of thousands of different proteins
- most structurally sophisticated molecules known
- each type has it's own unique 3 dimensional shape (confirmation)
- polymers constructed from 20 amino acid monomers
- polypeptide: many peptide bonds
- protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains
  -- most have several, though some have one
  -- folded or coiled to give confirmation
- have many different functions do to the many different structures

*** functions

- enzymatic proteins: selectively accelerate chemical reations
  -- digestive enzymes: accelerate hydrolosis of polymers in our food
- defensive proteins: protect us against disease.
  -- antibodies
- structural proteins: used for support
  -- collogen
  -- sunscreen: the sun breaks down collogen so sunscreen blocks the rays that do this
  -- keratin: fingernails, hair
- storage proteins: store amino acids
  -- ovalbutin in an egg whites
  -- seeds in a plant contain lots of storage proteins
- transport proteins: transport other substances+
  -- hemoglobin: transports oxygen into the cell & carbon dioxide out of the cell
- hormonal proteins: helps coordinate activities
  -- insulin
- receptor proteins: help the cell respond to chemical stimuli
  -- nerve cell, bind neurotransmitters
- contractile proteins (motor): function in movement
  -- actin and myosin in our muscles


*** amino acids

- they all have the same backbone, but contain different R groups
- asymetric or alpha carbon
- amino group on the alpha carbon

- glycine, simplest R group (H)
- alanine, R group CH_3 (methyl) asymetric
- acidic or basic
- hydrophobic or hydrophilic
- can contain a thyl group
- don't need to memorize all 20 amino acids, but should be familiar with the names
