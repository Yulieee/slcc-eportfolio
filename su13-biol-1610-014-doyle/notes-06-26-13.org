* ch 9, cellular respiration

- oxygen & organic fuel (glucose or similar) release a lot of co_2 & water & energy
- in eukaryotes it occures for the most part in the mitochondria
- the specific reaction for glucose

   C_6 H_12 O_6 + 6 O_2 -> 6 CO_2 + 6 H_2O + ATP + Heat

- catabolic, exergonic reaction
- will generate ATP so the cell can get work DONE
- redox reactions: transfer of electrons from one reaction to another
  -- reduction oxidation
  -- loss of electrons from one substance and the addition to another

*pneumonics*
- LEO GER
  -- LEO: lose electrons oxidize
  -- GER: gain electrons reduction
- OILRIG: oxidation is loss, reduction is gain

- oxidation & reduction always go together
  -- if something is losing electrons, something must gain electrons
- energy has to be added to pull an electron away from an atom
  -- depends on the electronegativity of the atom
- a redox reaction located close to oxygen, it actually releases potential energy

- cellular respiration, electrons are pulled away from molecules and given to oxygen

- in the above glucose reaction
  -- oxidation: C_6 H_12 O_6 ----> 6 CO_2
  -- reduction: 6 O_2 -----> 6 H_2 O

** electron shuttle
- cellular respiration does not work in one step
  -- it would be a bit explosive
- glucose gets oxidized in a series of steps
- NAD+ is our electron shuttle, it escorts our electrons along the pathway
  -- to the electron transport chain
  -- nicotinamide adanine dinucleotide?
  -- picks up to electrons, along with a hydrogen ion
  -- electron carrier
- dehydrogenase will remove the pair of hydrogen atoms from the glucose
  -- NAD+ -> NADH (reduction)
  -- NAD+ is the oxidized form
- electrons lose very little potential energy when transfered to NAD+
- typical destination for the NADH is the electron transport chain
- FAD is like a taxi; NAD+ is like a limo
  -- FADH2 once it picks up it's passenger
  -- anebolic?

- the electron transport chain breaks the fall o fH_2 + 1/2 O_2 -> H_2 O
  -- controlled release

- electron transport chain is made up mostly of protein molecules
- built into the inner membrane of mitochondria
- cascade down the chain
- we can say that, oxygen pulls electrons down this chain in an energy yeilding cascade

- glycolysis, citric acid cycle, oxidative phospholilation (electron transport chain) + chemiosmosis

** Stage 1: glycolysis
- occurs in the cytosal
- starts with glucose
- end with 2 pyruvate
- breaks sugar in half
- convert pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A
  -- goes into citric acid cycle

- 10 steps
- glucose -> glucose 6-phosphate -> fructose 6-phosphate
  -- step 1: hexokinase (glucose -> glucose 6-phosphate)
  -- step 2: phosphoglucoisomerase (glucose 6-phosphate -> fructose 6-phosphate, isomer)
  -- TODO list and understand steps
- requires a little bit of energy to start, but has an energy payoff phase
- kinase are involved in phosphorilation

- first 5 steps, energy investment
- second 5 steps, energy payoff

*** remember
- we need to know where each step is occuring
- what the starting inputs are
- what the products are

** Stage 2: citric acid cycle
- takes place in mitochondrial matrix
  -- ACOA
- some CO_2 is produced in this step
- ACOA is oxidized to form CO_2

- if oxygen is present, pyruvate can go into the mitochondria & go through the citric acid cycle
  -- pyruvate -> Acetyl CoA
     --- decarboxylation
     --- reduce NAD+ -> NADH

- 8 steps
  - all the carbons will get released as CO_2
  - start & finished with oxaloacetate

- the point at which glucose is completely oxidized to form CO_2
- all ATP in glycolysis & citric acid cycle is substrate level phosphorilation

*** remember
- where
- what it starts with
- what it's named after
- does it have a substrate level phosphorilation
- end products (what's produced)

** Stage 3: electron transport chain
- needs oxygen
  -- how long can we live without oxygen?
  -- metabolism slows in cold water drowning
- oxidative phosphorilation
  -- ~90% of the ATP
- coupled with chemiosmosis to make ATP

- NADH, FADH_2

- chemiosmosis
  -- oxidative phosphorilation
  -- ATP synthase

*** remember
- Q, CoQ 10
- cytochromes

** anaerobic
   - the condition where no oxygen is present
   - some prokaryotes
   - use a different final electron acceptor at the bottom of the electron transport chain
     -- like sulfur
** fermentation
   - uses only substrate level phosphorilation
   - occurs without oxygen present (anaerobic)
   - only glycolysis
   - alcohol fermentation
