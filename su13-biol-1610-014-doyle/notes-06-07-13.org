* ch 5

** proteins

*** amino acids

- linking 2 amino acids requires dehydration
- creates a peptide bond
- linking amino acids requires an ensyme called the ribosome
- ribosome has messenger rna, copy of the gene
  -- reads 3, forms, reads 3, forms, ...

- carboxyl of one amino acid reacts with the hydroxyl of another to create a peptide bond

*** enzymes

- protein function dependent on shape
- shape is dependent on amino acid sequence

- enzymes usually end in -ase
  -- sometimes end in -zyme (older)
  -- lysizyme, helix (coil, spiral)

- Globular: many proteins are roughly spherical
- Fibrous: others may be shaped like long fibers (collogen, silk)

- most proteins recognize & can bind to other molecules (foreign substances)
  -- usually have a pocket or group that binds to the other molecule
  -- it will usually convert that molecule to another product

*** protein structure

**** Primary: sequence of amino acids
**** Secondary: (two kinds) polypeptide segments are coiled or folded.
- alpha helix (coiled) plenty in our hair, in lysozyme
- beta pleated sheets (folded) fingernails / toenails
- CAUSED BY: formed by hydrogen bonding at regular intervals along the amino acid backbones

**** Tertiary: taking into account the interactions of the side chains (different R groups)
- overall shape of the polypeptide
- interactions depend on the specific properties of the side-chains
- localized regions of interaction that can occur
- can form hydrophobic interactions (non-polar)
  --- in globular proteins these hydrophobic regions are often in the center
- can form polar side chains
- can form ionic bonds in side chains
- dysulphide bridge: covalent bridges

**** Quantinary: 2 or more polypeptides that come together to form the functional protein
- all the same interactions as a tertiary structure
  -- hydrogen
  -- ionic
  -- dysulphide
  -- etc

transferitine: has 4 different polypeptides
hemoglobin: 4 polypeptides, 2 identical alpha chains & 2 identical beta chains

*** native confirmation of a protein

**** denaturation / renaturation


                 ->     Denaturation    ->

(Normal protein)                             (Denatured Protein)

                 <-     Renaturation    <-


Heating up an egg-white -> denaturation (can't be renatured)

- chemical cahnges like pH & salt concentration can denature proteins
  -- interupt the secondary, tertiary, and Quantinary structure
  -- interrupting hydrogen bonds can do this

- denaturation will change the function (structure) of a protein
- sometimes you can renature the protein (bring it back to it's normal form): restores function


*** chaperonin proteins

- assist in the folding of other proteins
- if we assist proteins in a test tube, they will typically fold correctly. In the cell teh polypeptide uses the chaperonin protein to fold correctly.
- messenger RNA
  -- DNA ultimately programs protein

*** DNA

- Primary structure of a protein is programmed by The Gene (DNA)
- DNA is a polymer of nucleic acids
- nucleic acids store & transmit information

- DNA can inform it's own construction
  -- seperate the dna, and one side can be used to make the other side

- DNA informs RNA synthesis

1. Synthesis of mRNA
2. Movement of mRNA into cytoplasm
3. Synthesis of protein

- Messenger RNA is a copy of the DNA information
- codon, triplet

- DNA is usually a long molecule, consisting of hundreds or thousands of genes. We usually call this a chromosome.
  -- prokaryotes: usually circular chromosome
  -- eukaryotes: usually linear chromosome

*Flow of genetic information*
- DNA -> RNA -> Proteins

- ribosome is the site where polypeptides are synthesized

*** nucleotides

- a nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides
  -- poly-nucleotide

- a nucleotide has 3 parts
  -- Phosphate
  -- pentose sugar
  -- nitrogenous base

- if there is no phosphate group, we call it a nucleocide

- 2 kinds
  -- pyrimidines
  -- purines

- 3 important pyrimidines
  -- cytosine
  -- thymine
  -- uracil
- 2 important purines
  -- adenine
  -- guanine

- Use the first letter of the base to represent nucleotides
  -- DNA: GATC
  -- RNA: CUAG

- Ribose is the sugar used in RNA
- Deoxyribose is the sugar used in DNA
  -- removed an oxygen from carbon number 2

- *join nucleotides using a phosphodiester bond*
  -- covalent bond between the phosphate of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next

- DNA 3' end & a 5' end

- the two strands of dna run anti parallel
- the nitrogenous bases are the rungs, held together by hydrogen bonds


5' -  A  T  G  C  -  3'
3' -  T  A  C  G  -  5'

The order of bases in a gene will specify the amino acids that are synthesized

- 3 nucleotides will encode one amino acid

* ch 6: cells

- Won't be on next weeks exam

- all organisms are made up of cells
- cells are the smallest living unit
- many different single celled organisms, and many different multi-cellular organisms
- too small to see, so we use microscopes
  -- in the lab we use light microscopes (refract light to enlarge the view of the specimin)

*smallest to largest*
1. atoms
2. small molecules
3. lipids
4. proteins
5. ribosomes
6. viruses
7. small bacteria
8. mitochondria
9. most bacteria
10. nucleus
11. most plant and animal cells
12. human egg
13. frog egg
14. chicken egg
15. length of some nerve & muscle cells
16. human height

** cell fractionation

- tissue
- We can use a centrifuge to spin test tubes and seperate heavy and light things in tissue
- chloroplasts from spinach
- we want to break the cells up without destroying them
- chop spinach, put it into a buffer, pulse blend a bit
- pour it into test tubes and balance in a centrifuge
- spin at a relatively low speed
- the stuff at the bottom, we call the pellet
- the liquid on top is a supernatant
- put the supernatant into a clean toom, spin in the centrifuge again
- repeat, to collect the smaller & smaller things
- eventually we'll get a fraction that has all chloroplasts in it.
