* ch 6

** extra cellular matrix

- major component: glyco proteins
- major glyco protein: collagen

- collagen: big portion of human Body><ns0

- fibernectin
  -- connects to plasma membrane protein: integrins
  -- integrins are often attached to a cytoskeleton component

*** junctions

**** tight junctions
     - membrane functions get fused together forming a barrier
     - fluids don't pass, it's a barrier
     - some found in the brain & digestive tract; blood/brain junction

**** desmosomes
     - fasten cells together to form a sheet
     - similar to spot welds or rivets
     - fluid can get through
     - found in skin tissues

**** gap junctions
     - communicating junctions
     - provide cytoplasmic channels between adjacent cells
     - found in heart, pancreas


* ch 7

- membranes

** fluid mosaic

- bilayer of phospholipids
- embedded with proteins

- phospholipids are anthropathic molecules
  -- anthropathic molecules have both a hydrophilic & hydrophobic region

- we know this using freeze fracture techniques with cell membranes

- fluid because the cell mambrane isn't static
  -- can think of it like a moving ocean, sea
  -- most of the proteins & phospholipids drift around laterally

- when the phospholipids have many kinks in the tail the fluid mosaic membrane is more fluid at room temperature

- cholesterol
  -- lipid
  -- steroid
  -- find it only in animal cell membranes
  -- plants have a different steroid that takes on a similar role
  -- reduces membrane fluidity at moderate temperatures
     --- it does this by reducing the phospholipid movement
  -- when cold it will help prevent the membrane from solidifying
     --- prevents the phospholipids from packing together too tightly

*** integral & peripheral proteins
    - many of these are glyco proteins
      -- glyco proteins: has a short chained sugar attached

**** integral
     - penetrates and completely crosses the bilayer
     - all trans member proteins are integral proteins
       -- TODO huh? is this right?
     - typically have hydrophilic & hydrophobic regions
       -- anthropathic
     - n-terminus (amino end), the outside end of the protein
     - c-terminus, (carboxyl end); inside the membrane

**** peripheral
     - penetrates, but doesn't cross all the way through the bilayer
     - loosely bound to the surface
     - often bound to the exposed parts of integral member proteins

*** membrane proteins

- many different functions

**** transport

***** channel proteins
      - passive tranpsort
      - osmosis

***** carrier proteins
      - active transport
      - requires energy (ATP); some work by way of diffusion not always requiring ATP

**** ensymatic activity
     - active site, pocket or groove in the protein. Where a substrate binds & converts to a product.
     - bound to the membrane
     - they are often members of a sequential team of enzymes
     - whenever we have 2 or more, we'll often call them a complex

**** signal transduction
     - membrane receptor protein, that has a binding site for a chemical messenger
     - signal molecule
     - when a molecule binds to the receptor the signal molecule changes shape


*** other protein stuff
 - cell-cell recognition: glyco protein, blood types
 - intercellular joining: [tight, desmosomes, gap]
 - atachment to the cytoskeleton & extracellular matric (ECM): helps maintain cell shape, can help coordinate inter/extra-cellular activities
   -- integrins on the surface can connect to fibernectin, which attaches to the ECM

** permeability
   - transport vesicles
   - cell membranes have selective permeability
   - nonpolar molecules can dissolve right through the lipid bilayer: diffusion
     -- cross directly
   - anything that's polar or charged will probably need help from a protein (transport proteins)
   - transport proteins
     -- very specific
     -- aquaporin: hydrophilic channel, transports water
     -- carrier proteins will flip & change shape to move a molecule

*** passive & active transport
    - passive: diffusion w/ no energy investment
      -- thermal motion can cause diffusion
      -- diffusion: tendency of any molecule to spread out into space
      -- done by carrier and channel proteins
    - active: movement of molecules with energy required, only done by carrier proteins
      -- against solute concentration gradient

** concentrations/solutions - diffusion - passive transport
  - permeable membrane where concentration equalizes (dynamic equilibrium); no net movement of molecules
  - simple rule: in the absence of forces, a solution will diffuse from where it's more concentrated, to where it's less concentrated
  - diffusing down it's gradient
  - no work is required for diffusion
    -- it's a spontaneous process

  - much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion

*** osmosis
  - hypertonic: more solutes (hyperactive, hyperglycemic)
  - hypo tonic: less solutes

  - isotonic: both sides of cell are normal, not hyper, or hypo tonic

  - most animal cells are isotonic
