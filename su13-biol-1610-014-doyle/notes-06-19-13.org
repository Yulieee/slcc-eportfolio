** passive transport

** active transport
   - requires energy
   - changes shape to move molecules
   - cell must maintain certain cell concentrations
   - going against the gradient
   - cells are constantly pumping sodium out, and potassium in
   - ATP provides the energy for transport
   - phosphorlation: when a phospher group is bound to the carrier protein

   - sodium potassium pump
   - atp will phosphorlate the pump, changing it's shape
     -- flip the sodium ions out
     -- two potassium ions bind to the carrier
     -- releases the phosphate, which causes it to change shape and move potassium into the cell

   - all cells have voltage across their membrane
   - voltage is the seperation of opposite charges
   - inside a cell it's negatively charged (3 sodium out, 2 potassium in give negative voltage)
   - outside a cell there is a positive charge
   - membrane potential: voltage across the membrane

   - 2 forces at work:
     -- chemical force transport gradient
     -- electrical, the effect of the membrane potential
   - electro-chemical gradient
   - Na K pump helps keeping the membrane potential
   - electrogenic pump: transport protein that stores voltage in the cell
     -- Na K pump is the major eloctrogenic pump of animal cells
     -- For plant cells, the major electrogenic pump is called the proton pump

** cotransport
   - sucrose-H^+ cotransporter
     -- plants
     -- requires both H^+ and a sucrose to work
     -- the proton pump moves the H^+ out, then it comes back in by the sucrose-H^+ pump
   - in animals
     -- sodium-glucose pump
     -- similarly uses the sodium of the Na-K pump

** vesicle/vacuole transport
   - exocytosis: secreting things with vesicles
   - endocytosis: importing molecules with vesicles
   - large molecules are transported using vesicles

*** endocytosis
   - phagocytosis
   - pinocytosis
   - receptor-mediated endocytosis

**** phagocytosis
   - eating
   - wraps around a food particles
   - vacuole

**** pinocytosis
   - drinking
   - smaller amount of non-specific extracellular fluid

**** receptro-mediated endocytosis
   - specific, requiring receptors to bind to a specific substance
   - ligand, the substance that gets bound

* ch 8

  - metabolism: totality of an organisms chemical reactions
  - organized into metabolic pathways, with many steps
  - alter molecules, in a series of definite steps
  - each step categorized by different enzymes
  - there are some mechanisms that balance enzymes
  - regulatory enzymes
  - some pathways release energy, done by breaking down complex molecules into simpler components
    -- catabolism, catabolic pathway
    -- cellular respiration
  - anabolic pathways consume energy, build complex molecules from simpler molecules
    -- biosynthetic pathways
    -- making a polypeptide; requires energy, builds protein
  - catabolism energy can be used in anabolism
  - energy is the capacity to do work
    -- exists in different forms

** energy

*** kinetic
    - energy of motion

*** potential
    - stored energy
    - the energy that matter contains due to structure or location
    - chemical energy is a type of potential energy

*** conversion
    - energy can be converted back and forth between potential and kinetic

*** thermodynamics
   - closed & open
     -- closed cannot interact with surroundings
     -- open can interact with surroundings
   - all living organisms are open systems
   - we also release heat & carbon dioxide into systems

*Laws Of Thermodynamics*
1. Energy can be transformed, but not created or destroyed. Energy is
   constant
2. Entropy is increasing. Disorder of the univers is increasing. Every
   energy transfer, makes the universe more disordered. Some is due to
   increasing amounts of heat.

---

   - entropy: quantity that is used as a measure of disorder, we use the
     symbol S
   - the quantity of energy is constant, but the quality isn't. It's
     getting more disordered
   - for a process to occur on it's own, it has to increase the entropy
     of the universe
   - spontaneous process is a change that can occur without outside help
   - non-spontaneous processes will occur only if energy is added
   - biological systems increase the entropy of their surroundings

*** free energy (G)
   - measures the portion of a systems energy that can perform work
   - \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
     --  T is absolute temp in Kelvin
     -- \Delta S is change in entropy
     -- \Delta H TODO
   - spontaneous processes have a negative \Delta G
   - free energy is also a measure of a systems instability
     -- or tendency to change state

   - examples: moving towards stability
     -- gravitational force
     -- diffusion
     -- chemical reactions

   - free energy is a measure of how much work a system can perform
   - equilibrium is a state of maximum stability
     -- no further change in the concentrations of reactant and products
     -- free energy == 0

*** exergonic/endergonic reactions
   - exergonic: \Delta G is negative, releases energy, spontaneous
     -- less products
   - endergonic: \Delta G is posite, requires energy
     -- generates more products
     -- e.g. photosynthesis (energy comes from the sunlight)

*** ATP
   - Adenosine tryphosphate
     -- adenine bonded to 5 sugar carbon ribose, then bonded to three
     phosphate groups
   - ADP missing one phosphate
   - ATP -> ADP + P + energy

   - enzymes in the cell can couple endergonic reactions to exergonic reactions
     -- phosphorlated molecule
     -- more reactive after phospholation
     -- endergonic to exergonic
   - glutamic acid + ammonia => glutamine

   - ATP cycle
   - ATP is regenerated very quickly in the cell

** enzymes

   - energy of activation
   - there is usually a hill that we have to go up for a reaction to
     occur (energy of activation)
   - (-ase) most enzymes end with this suffix
     -- sucrase: catalyzes sucrose into glucose & fructose
   - catalyst: chemical agent that changes the rate of a reaction
     without being consumed by the reaction
   - active site: the pocket where a substrate binds to the enzyme
   - substrate complex: when a substrate is bound to an enzyme
   - enzymes are substrate specific
   - induced fit, change of shape in a substrate complex. The enzyme
     kind of encloses over the substrate. Brings groups of the active
     site, that enhance the reaction
