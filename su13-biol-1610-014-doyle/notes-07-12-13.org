** meiosis

- end up with 4 different haploid cells
  -- all different

- interphase
  -- chromosomes are replicated
  -- similar to s-phase

- all of the homologous chromosomes pair up
- synaptineal comlpex
- tetrat
- chiasma
  -- chi: greek letter for x
  -- x chromosome regions
  -- homologous chromosomes are exchanging dna
  -- crossing over

- nucleoulus disappears
- chromosome pairs move towards the metaphase plate
- pro phase 1 takes about 90% of the time for meiosis

- metaphase 1
  -- homolougous pairs of chromosomes line up on the plate
  -- easily distinguishable from the meta phase of mitosis

- anaphase
  -- homologous chromosomes are going to seperate

- tilaphase
  -- things reform

- 46 chromosomes line up in mitosis
- 23 pairs line up in meiosis

- independent assortment, the random alignment on the metaphase plate
  -- ultimately determines which sister cell they end up in

- meiosis produces two sister cells that are different

- miosis reduced the chromosomes in half

- 3 events unique to meiosis
  -- synapsis
  -- genetic rearrangement, crossing over
  -- random fertilization

- end results are different
  -- mitosis
     --- 1 division
     --- 2 diploid
  -- meiosis
     --- 2 divisions
     --- 4 haploid

- synapsis

- crossing over
  -- combinous chromosomes
  -- for humans 1-3 crossovers is common
  -- occurs during pro-phase 1
  -- over 8 million different combinations
  -- 46 choose 23

- random fertilization
  -- causes a lot more variation

* ch 14

- mendel
  -- monk in austria
  -- 1800
  -- inheritance
  -- statistics

- around the same time as darwin
  -- 1859-1860

- darwin's research was understood, but not accepted
- mendel's work wasn't really understood, and his work was rediscovered
  in the early 1900

- mendel discovered the particulate nature of inheritance
  -- he thought there was some kind of particle that accounts for
  inheritance
  -- genes

- discovered the basics of genetics
  -- careful experiments with garden peas
- heritable features
  -- characters
  -- flower color, seed shape, seed color
  -- traits; variants for a character

- he would cut off stamen to prevent self fertilization
  -- manually dust the flowers with pollen allowing selection of breeding
- first generation were all purple
- true breeding
- hybridization
- p generation, f1 generation
  -- f2 generation
- discovered 2 fundamental principles of heredity
  -- law of segregation
  -- law of independent assortment

- law of segregation
  -- only saw the dominant character in the f1 generation
  -- only purple flowers
  -- if allowed to self polinate or cross polinate amongst the f1
  generation
     --- 1/4 would show the recessive trait again
  -- monohybrid crosses
     --- looking at one trait at a time

- PP; homozygous dominant
- pp; homozygous recessive
- Pb; heterozygous, will have the dominant trait

- law of independent assortment
  -- genes on different chromosomes are indepentantly inherited
  -- yellow doesn't always fit with round, etc.
- linked genes: traits that are close to eachother and are often
  inherited together

- multiplication rule
  -- P(E) = 1
  -- \sum_i P(e_i), where e \in E
