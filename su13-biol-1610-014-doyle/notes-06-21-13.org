** substrate binding in an enzyme
  - active site
  - enzyme substrate complex
  - catylize
  - substrates get converted to product

  - the active site can bend and break bonds in the substrate
  - brief covalent bonding between a substrate and the active site
  - the enzyme will always remain

  - enzymes lower senergy of activation
    1. stressing bonds (bending the molecule/substrate)
    2. acting as a template (orient the substrate so they can react)
    3. low ph TODO
    4. brief covalent bonding between substrate & active site TODO

  - concentration of substrate will affect rate of reaction
  - the activity of an ezyme is effected by temperature or ph
  - high temperature of ph can denature the protein, which loses or alters function
  - there are other chemicals that can also alter an ezymes function
  - there are optimal environments for each enzyme

** cofactors

  - non protein helpers to an enzyme
  - usually necessary
  - they can bind tightly and permanently to an active site
  - some cofactors bind reversibly with the substrate
  - depends on the enzyme
  - zync, iron, copper are some important examples (trace minerals)
  - coenzyme: a cofactor that is an organic molecule
    -- vitamins

** inhibitors
  - some chemicals can selectively inhibit enzymes
  - if an inhibitor forms covalent bonds with an enzyme it is irreversible
    -- lead, mercury, cyanide
  - if an inhibitor binds with weak bonds, the inhibition is reversible
    -- it will eventually fall off
  - two kinds of inhibition
    -- competitive inhibitor: reversible, happens when an inhibitor
    binds to the active site. compeats with the substrate for the active site.
    -- noncompetitive inhibitor:  binds to another part of the enzyme
    (alosteric site)

** alosteric enzymes
  - regulatory enzymes
  - they have an alosteric site
  - a regulatory molecule can bind to an alosteric enzyme changing
    it. This can enable/stabilize it or inhibit it
  - can be multi-subunit enzyme
  - cooperativity
    -- binding one substrate can make the other active sites more likely
    to bind in a multi-subunit enzyme

** feedback
  - alosteric/regulartory enzymes control the rates of key reactions in
    metabolic pathways
  - isoleucine (an amino acid, nonessential)
    -- it will inhibit it's own production, when it's concentration gets
    too high
  - multi enzyme complexes
    -- several enzymes stuck together
    -- usually of the same pathways
    -- product of the first reaction becomes the substrate of the next

* optional assignment: paper on an article

- if you do the paper & score 80%, drop lowest midterm exam
- document is on the mastering biology website
- due july 19th
- submit online
- have to focus on a biological issue, specifically cellular, molecular,
  or chemical in nature
  -- medical is almost always appropriate
  -- should be controversial
  -- use articles published in the last year
- peer reviewed journal
- works cited
  -- don't plagiarize
- include copy of articles
- describe biological focus
- may need to find out more about the topic
- define & summarize the issue
- most important to describe the science of the issue
- give own opinions or suggestions and comments
- minimum 3 full pages
- clear the topic with the teacher

* TODO extra credit assignments in ch 9
- due july 10th
- 7.5 points each
- figure 9.9: glycolysis, reproduce this in a way that will help you
  remember it. Write down the title, write down where it occurs
  (cytosal). Underline, circle or highlight that. Draw the ten
  steps. Write down the starting product (glucose). Draw arrow from
  glucose converted to -> write enzyme (hexocynase) -> glucose 6
  phosphate -> (phosphoflucto isomerase)-> fructose...
  -- at bottom write down final products (2nadh, 2piruvate, 2atp)

- figure 9.12
  -- cytric acid cycle
  -- write where it occurs (mitochondrial matrix) highlight/underline/circle
  -- cycle
  -- starting product (acetyl coenzyme A) highlight
  -- added to oxaloacetate
  -- can just write them, don't need to draw all the chemical structures
  -- at bottom write final products in  one turn of the cycle (2co2,
  3nadh, 1fadh2, 1atp) highlight
