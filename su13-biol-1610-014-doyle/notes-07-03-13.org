* TODO extra credit on citric cycle & glycolosis
* TODO extra credit report
* ch 10
** glycolisis & citric acid cycle
** photosynthesis

- light reactions
- thylakoid membrane
- forms ATP & NADPH & O_2

- calvin cycle
- occurs in the stroma

*** electron flow
- linear (non-cyclic) electron flow
- cyclic flow

- TODO follow through the steps for electron flow, I didn't get good notes on these
- p680+ strongest biological oxidizing agent known
- ps1 p700+

*** calvin cycle
** notes
- pep carboxylase
- different types of plants

* ch 11
- chemical signals
- signal transduction pathway
- signal on the cells surface to some kind of response in the cell
- similar between yeast & animals

- plasmadesmota / gap junctions

- local signaling, paracrin signaling
- growth factor
- synaptic signaling

- long distance signaling, hormones
- endocrin signaling

- reception, transduction, and response

- g protein-coupled receptor
  -- many types
  -- all have similarities
  -- require a g protein structure
  -- widespread & diverse in functions

- transcription factor
- intracellular receptor

- plasma membrane receptors
- some benefits to having multi-step pathways
- one benefit is that the signal can be greatly amplified

- kinase: phosphorilation
- widly involved in eukaryotic signaling pathways
- usually activates a protein

- protein kinase & protein phosphonase
