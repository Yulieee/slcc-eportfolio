* Ch 1
** taxonomy

- classification of organisms
- major changes in field because now we can sequence dna

- bacteria, archaea, eukarya
*** eukary kingdoms
**** protists
- pond water
**** kingdom plantae
- multi cellular
- photosynthesis (light -> sugar)
- producers
**** fungi
- yeast, mold, mildew, mushrooms
- get nutrition by decomposing other organisms & ingesting that material
- cell types: eukariotic cells
**** animalia
- multi cellular eukariotic
- eat other organisms
- consumers

** evolution
- read this

*** natural selection

- members of a population that have the attributes or traits best suited
to an environment will be the most likely to survive or reproduce. Thus
passing on their genes and traits.
- There is always variations
- there is always competition do to overpopulation
- this helps to adapt species to their environment
- environments can change over time
- over-crowding can lead to a population having to move environments


**** environment with a fire
1. population with varied inherited traits
2. elimination of individuals with certain traits
3. reproduction of survivors
4. increasing frequency of traits that enhance survival and reproductive success


**** theme in biology
- form fits function
- true at all levels of biological organization

**** finches
- common ancestor with different food sources
- development of differing beaks

**** discover sciene & hypothesis based Science
- discovery: describing nature
- hypothesis: understanding or explaining

- Jane Goodall: Chimpanzees, discovery

***** hypothesis
- a hypothesis is a tentative answer to a well-framed question
- it must be testable and identifiable
- no amount of testing can prove a hypothesis

***** scientific method
- not always strictly adheared to
- typically we always start off with observation

***** testing one variable
- controlled experiment
- compare an experimental group & a control group
- seeing if a new drug is effective
- double blind experiment (neither the researcher or participant know
  who's getting a drug, etc.)

***** theory
- broader than a hypothesis
- attempts to relate multiple areas of understanding
- based on the best explanation
- supported by a great body of evidence

***** science & tech
- interrelated
- tech applies scientific knowledge


** themes that unify bio review

*** 1. cells
- prokaryotic, eukariotic
- membrane
- genetic material dna

*** 2. heritable information
- carried from generation 2 generation by  dna

- linear & circular chromosomes

*** 3. immergent properties
- each level of bio organization has immergent properties

- atoms & molecules
- cellular
- tissue
- organ
- organism
- population
- etc

*** 4. feedback regulation
- positive & negative
- negative is more common

- negative will halt or slow down

*** 5. open systems
- organisms interact continually with their environment

-
*** 6. energy & life
- all organisms have to work
- sunlight -> producers -> consumers

*** 7. unity & diversity
- dual faces of life on earth

- three domains
-- TODO list these
-- 4 kingdoms in eukaria

*** 8. evolution & natural selection

*** 9. structure & function & function are always related

- always true at each level
- even at the level of proteins
- form follows function

*** 10. science is a process of inquiry
- includes repeatable observations and testable hypothesis
-

*** 11. science & tech are functions of society
- tech is goal oriented application of science


** building blocks of dna
building blocks of dna
gact

building blocks of proteins
amino acids

Basis of chemistry

- get a copy of the periodic table & refer to it regularly for this chapter
- lots of definition

** matter
- chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds
- matter is made up of elements
- elements cannot be broken down
- 92 elements that occur in nature
- more that are made in a lab
- each element has a symbol

- compound: 2 or more elements in a fixed ratio

- sodium + chlorine => table salt (sodium chloride)

- life requires 25 elements

- 96% of living matter is composed of 4 elements
-- oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen

- sulfer, phosphorous are also very important

- trace elements: required by an organism in tiny quantities
-- e.g. iodine in our thyroid gland (prevent goiter?)

- the atomic structure of an element determines the behavior of that
  element
- atom is the smallest unit of matter that still retains props of the
  element
- subatomic particles (neutron, protons, & electron)
- atomic nucleus: neutrons & protons packed together
- electrons form a cloud around the nucleus, move really fast

- helium (He): 2 protons & 2 neutrons

- protons & neutrons: mass of 1 amu (atomic mass unit)
- dalton (D): same as an AMU
- electron mass is considered negligible (mass is usually ignored)
- all atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons
  (Atomic Number). A subscript to the left of the chemical symbol.
- carbon_6 (C)
- nitrogen_7 (N)
- oxygen_8 (O)
- sodium_11 (Na)
- hydrogen_1 (H)

- unless otherwise indicated you can assume an element is
  uncharged. (same number of protons & electrons)

- mass number: (sum #protons #neutrons)
  -- Na_11 w/ a mass of 23 means 12 neutrons
  -- isotopes have differing number of neutrons (mass_number != 2 * atomic_number)

- sometimes on a periodic table you'll get the avg of occuring isotopes:
  e.g. H -> 1.008

- isotopes will behave identically in chemical reactions
- many stable isotopes, but there are some radioactive isotopes.
- a radioactive will have a decaying nucleus that gives off energy
- carbon_14 decays to form nitrogen
- can be used to trace metabolism, etc

- if the nucleus were the size of a golf ball, the electrons would be a
  kilometer away
  -- most of an atom is empty space
  -- nucleus is very compact

- nuclei do not react in chemical reactions
  -- only the electrons

- an atoms electrons will vary in the amount of energy an atom has
  -- ability to do work

- potential energy
  -- based on electrons in an atom (position to the nucleus)
  -- energy an object stores due to position or location (arrangement)
  -- similar to water in a reservoir on a hill (more potential energy)
  -- closest electrons to the nucleus have the least amount of energy

- negative & positive attraction

- energy levels in an electron
  -- electron shells
  -- ball bouncing down a flight of stairs
  -- first shell is closes (lowest energy)
  -- first row have electrons in first shell
  -- second row, second shell... ad infinitum
  -- photosynthesis: electrons absorbing light energy and moving shells

- an elements chemical behavior depends on it's distrobution of electrons

- first shell holds 2 electrons
  -- 2nd & 3rd can hold up to 8

- Ne_10 (Neon): 2 electrons in the first shell, 8 in the second

- The outermost shell (valence shell): affects an atoms chemical structure

- flourine & chlorine (7 valence electrons) - both poisonous, similar properties

*** Electron Orbitals

the 3d space where an electron spends 90% of it's time
- a maximum of 2 electrons in any orbital
- 1 orbital in the first shell: 1_S orbital (spherical)
- 4 orbitals in the second shell

**** orbitals in Ne
- 10 electrons
  -- 1_S orbital (2 electrons)
  -- 2_S orbital (2 electrons)
  -- 2_Py orbital (dumbell, figure 8 shaped) (2 electrons)
  -- 2_Px orbital (2 electrons)
  -- 2_Pz orbital (2 electrons)

**** valence shell
- atoms want to react in order to complete their valence shell
- give up or share their electrons

**** chemical bonds
- sharing of valence electrons
- covalance bonds (strong)
- ionic bonds (strong if no water present)

- a single covalent bond equals a pair of shared electrons

- hydrogen needs 2 to coomplete valence shell
- molecular hydrogen (H2) covalent bond

- molecular oxygen (O2) double covalent bond
  -- 2 pairs of shared electrons

- water (H2O) - covalent bond
  -- 2 covalent bonds

- methane (CH4) - 4 covalent bonds

- molecular formula (H_2)
- structural formula (H - H)
