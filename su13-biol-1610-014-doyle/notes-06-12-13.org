* ch 6: cont'd

- prokaryotic: smaller & much simpler
- eukaryotic: larger with many membrane bound organelles


- all cells have a membrane
- all cells have cytosal / cytoplasm
- all cells have chromosomes carry DNA
- all cells have ribosomes


- eurkaryotes: nave a nucleus
- prokaryotes: nucleoid (concentrated reagion of dna, etc. but not a nucleus)


- diffusion
- cells don't get larger, just more of them
  -- i.e. a whale
  -- large cells would hurt diffusion
- r r^2 r^3 (surface area doesn't scale relative to the volume as a cell gets larger)
  -- harms diffusion


- phospholipid bilayer

  -- embedded in this layer are many proteins & molecules
  -- many of these embedded proteins are called glycoproteins

- a glycoprotein is a protein with a short chain sugar covalently attached to it

- eukaryotic cells have many membranes
  -- many membranes contain enzymes
  -- these compartments have many different localized environments in the cell


- lysosomes, centriols, and flagellum are only found in animal cells

- chloroplasts are only found in plant cells


** nucleus

- nuclear dna, nuclear genes
- houses the majority of dna

- the nuclear envelope seperates the nucleus from the cytoplasm
  -- has pores with protein structures that line each door
- the nuclear lamina (lines the inside of the nucleus, except the pores)
  -- lines the filiments
  -- like the beams & girders of the nucleus
  -- made out of intermediate filiments
  -- gives the nucleus it's shape


- DNA is a long molecule needs to prevent tangling
  -- wrapped up on associated proteins
  -- chromotin: dna + associated proteins
  -- chromosomes: thicker structures of condensed chromotin

- nucleolus
  -- darkly staining region
  -- may be more than one (nucleoli)
  -- where ribosomal rna is synthesized

- messenger rna is made in the nucleus

** ribosomes

- build the proteins
- *made up of rrna and proteins*

- carry out protein synthesis
- free ribosomes float in the cytosal
  -- tend to make proteins that stay in the cytosal
- bound ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum
  -- as the ribosome starts making the polypeptide, it can signal to be
  inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum

- the endoplasmic reticulum is continuous with the nuclear envelope


** endomembrane system

- large system where the membranes are related
- can be related by direct physical continuity
- can be related by membrane transport vesicles

- *these make up the endomembrane system*
- nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, lysosomes, vasecules,
  plasma membrane
  -- either directly attached or related by transport vesicles

- ER accounts for more than half of the total membrane in the cell
  -- smooth ER: no ribosomes
  -- rough ER: many bound ribosomes
*** ER

**** smooth
- can synth lipids, carbs, and can detox drugs. can synth steriods, phospholipids

**** rough
- the inside is called the lumin
- membrane protein: protein that's partially attached to the rough ER
- glycoproteins: protein that's inserted all the way inside the rough er

- these bound ribosomes will make proteins that go to anaother
  organelle, or will be secreted, or bound

**** transitional ER

- membrane pouch
- contains proteins to be secreted
- turns out transport vesicles


** golgi

- finish sort & ships products

- fuse with the golgi (dump products)
- products are further modified
- they then may be shipped


- made of flattened membranous sacks
  -- cisternae

- polar organelle
  -- two different sides
  -- cis face (receiving)
  -- trans (shipping)

- often glycoproteins are further modified by the golgi
- it can also make polysacharides

- typically molecules are sorted (tagged with maybe a phosphate group)

- when vesicles are leaving the trans, they may have external molecules
  that control where they go

** lysosomes

- part of the endo membrane system
- not in plants
- digestive compartments

- contains hydrolitic enzymes
- used to digest other molecules, sometimes other organelles

- acidic (pH of about 5)

- once molecules are digested, the broken up monomers can cross the
  lysosome membrane

- some animal cells engulf food, phagophytosis
  -- white blood cells

- vacuoles
  -- larger than vesicles

- plants & fungi may have one or more vacuole
  -- plants usually have a large central vacuole
  -- tonoplast membrane
  -- part of the plants endomembrane system
  -- usually the largest compartment in a plant cell
  -- storage, wast disposal, and growth

** mitochondria / chloroplasts

- major energy transformers of the cell

- mitochondria: sites of cellular respiration
  -- use oxygen to get fuels from sugars
  -- generates atp, co2, water, & some heat
  -- all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria

- all cells need atp

- chloroplasts: only found in plants & algea
  -- sites of photosynthesis
  -- co2 + water + sun: glucose + o2
  -- sort of like the inverse of cellular respiration

- both
  -- have a double membrane
  -- have their own dna
  -- circular dna (circular dna is also seen in prokaryotes)
  -- very similar to prokaryotes
  -- *endo symbiosis*


*** mitocondria

- smooth outer layer
- folded inner membrane

- inner membrane space: space between two membrane layers
- matrix: contains enzymes for cellular respiration


*** chloroplasts

- similar double membrane
- inside: flattened sacks called the thylakoid
- fluid inside is called the stroma

- thylakoids are green because they have chloryphyl
  -- necessary for photosynthesis

**** peroxisome

- h2o2
  -- can be damaging to the cell

- can break down fatty acids
- can help detoxify


** cytoskeleton

- cell skeleton



- network of fibers that extend throughout the cell
  -- throughout the cytoplasm
- organizes structures and activities of the cell

- provides structural support in the cell
- also functions in cell motility

- involved in cell division

- made up of 3 types of molecules
  -- microtubules: thickest kind of involved molecule
  -- microfilaments (actin): thinnest
  -- intermediate filaments


*** microtubules

- tubulin subunit
- adding microtubular subunits -> polymerizing
- removing microtubular subunits -> de-polymerizing

- microtubules will seperate chromosomes before/during cell division

- also involved in cilia & flagela
  -- made up of microtubules
  -- make them move
  -- need a motor molecule
  -- needs atp

- 9 by 2 arrangement of cillia & flagela microtubules
- anchored by a basil body (9 by 0 arrangement)

*** microfilaments

- fiber
- present in all eukaryotic cells
- play a role in tension
- responsible for changes in cell shape

- cell cortext: layer of microfilaments

*** intermediate filaments

- bear tension
- composed of a diverse class of proteins
  -- carotenes

- more permenant fixtures of cells

- function in cell shape
- anchoring the nucleus

- *makeup nuclear lamina*

- defects in these filaments can call lu-garricks disease (ALS)

** stay

- plant cells have a cell wall
- all cells have a cell membrane
- plant cell walls composed of various substances (mainly cellulose)

- channels through these walls for communication
  -- plasma desmada
  -- allows cytoplasm of neighboring cells to be continuous

- some animal cells will have an extracellular matrix
  -- functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation
  -- collagen, fibronectin, proteoglycan complex
  -- glyco proteins (major glycoprotein is collagen, ~40% of protein in
  the human body)
