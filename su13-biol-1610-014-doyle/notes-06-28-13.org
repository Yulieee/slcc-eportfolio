* ch 9, cont'd
- cellular respiration
- citric acid cycle
- electric transport change

- glycolosis occurs in the cytosal, glucose to pyruvate
- phosphfructokinase
- citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix
  -- needs acetyl coA
  -- end products: 2CO_2 3NADH FADH_2 ATP?
  -- 4CO_2 6NADH 2FADH_2 2ATP, because there are 2 pyruvate
- electron transport chain
- oxidative phosphorilation: provides most of our ATP
- substrate level phosphorilation
- cells can switch to fermentation when no oxygen is present

** getting energy from food
- we break down our foods into monomers
- starches -> monosaccharides (specifically glucose)
- glycogen (animal starch) stored in liver & (TODO OTHER Place)
- other carbohydrates can be converted into glucose

- proteins, broken down into amino acids
  -- if they're essential, they'll likely be used & recycled in the body
  -- otherwise they'll be used as fuel
  -- deaminate them, remove the amino group
     --- this is why a very high protein diet can be tough on your kidneys
  -- deaminated compounds can be used in various steps of the cellular respiration cycle

- fats
  -- glycerol, fatty acids
  -- glycerol used in glycolysis
  -- fatty acids can be used with/as acetyl coA

- anabolic pathways
- we can store additional food as fat

** cellular respiration control
- cellular respiration can be controlled
- feedback regulation
- inhibitors & stimulators
  -- regulatory or alosteric enzymes
- we can speed or slow down ATP production

- phosphofructokinase (the one enzyme we absolutely need to remember in this chapter)
  -- kinase, phosphorilation
  -- fructose
  -- earliest step in the process that commits the molecule to the process
  -- inhibitors would have to stop it before this step
  -- by controlling this rate it can speed up or slow down the entire process
  -- stimulated by AMP, adenosine monophosphate
     --- high levels when ATP is very low
  -- also inhibited by citrate (citric acid cycle)
     --- citric acid traffic jam
     --- helps keep glycolysis & citric acid cycle synchronized

* ch 10, photosynthesis
- forgot to take this quiz last night... doh!

- autotrophs (self-feeders)
  -- produce they're own molecules from CO_2
  -- sources of organic compounds
- photoautotroph: uses light
- heterotrophs: us, animals, consumers
  -- dependent on autotrophs

- chloroplasts: are the major sites of photosynthesis
  -- chlorophyll is green
  -- chlorophyll absorbs the light energy & drives the production of food molecules

- chlorophyll
  -- 2 membranes
  -- stroma & thylokoids
  -- stacked thylokoids: granum

- basic equation for photosynthesis

    6CO_2 + 6H_2O + (light) --> C_6 H_12 O_6 + 6 O_2

- we don't really produce glucose in photosynthesis
  -- we produce 2 3-carbon sugars which can easily be converted into glucose
- the O_2 comes from the splitting of water
- photosynthesis is a redox reaction

- light reactions & calvin cycle

- light reactions
  -- occurs in the thylakoid membrane

- calvin cycle (carbon fixation)
  -- occurs in the stroma


** energy from the sun
- electromagnetic energy
- traveling in waves
- mixing all colors we get white light

*** absorbance spectrum of chloryphyl
- chlorophyll a
- chlorophyll b
- carotenoids

- absorption spectrum
- action spectrum
- engelmann's experiment

*** absorbing photons

- photon strikes chlorophyll, which energizes one of it's electrons and moves it to a higher orbital
- sometimes in the excited state it produces heat and flourescence when dropping back down to it's ground state
- usually in photosynthesis, the excited electron is stolen for use in the photosynthesis process

*** light system
- thylakoid membrane
- reaction center
- lots of pigment molecules
- conceptually like a satellite dish

*** reaction center
- protein complex
- primary electron receptor

- 2 types of photosystems
  - type I & II

- type I: P700
- type II: P680

- they were named 1 & 2 based on when they were discovered, not how they are used

*** linear electron flow
- produces both NADP + H & ATP
- chemiosmosis, photophsosphorilation

*** cyclic electron flow
- occurs in certain conditions, only photosystem 1 gets used
- produces no NADP, no O_2
- only produces ATP
- linear electron flow doesn't produce all the ATP necessary

we have an array of length x, and given a percentage we want to know how many samples to pull
- we can simply multiply x with the percentage as a decimal to get what we want
