- molarity: moles of sollute per liter of solution

Glucose - (C_6 H_12 O_6) - 180 D

** acidic & basic conditions

- sometimes protons will shift from one module to another

- Hydroxide Ion => (OH^-)
- Hydrogen Ion => (H^+) => Proton

- changes of the concentration of hydroxid and hydrogen ions are very
  important and we measure these changes on the pH scale

- acids increase this change of concentration
- acids are hydrogen ion donors

- Hydrochloric acid: Strong Acid
- HCl + H_2 O -> H^+ Cl^- + H_2 O

- bases are hydrogen ion receptors

- (N H_3) + (H^+) <=> (N^+ H_4)
- ammonia (N H_3) acted as a base accepting a hydrogen ion

- Sodium Hydroxide: (Strong base)
- NaOH -> Na^+ + OH^-
                 OH^- + H^+ <=> H_2 O
- Strong base: completely disassociates

- Weak Acid / Base: reversible reaction

** pH scale

- neutral: same number of hydroxide ions and hydrogen ions (pH 7)
- more hydrogen ions -> acidic
- less hydrogen ions -> basic

- logarithmic scale

** buffers

- buffers help solutions resist changes to pH (minimize changes in pH)
- if pH swung drastically it would create a dangerous environment

- buffers can act as a base or an acid as needed
- most buffers consist of a weak acid & it's corresponding base

- carbonic acid:    H_2 C O_3 <=> HCO_3^- + H^+
- bicarbonate ion:  HCO_3^- <=> CO_3^-2 + H^+

* ch 4: organic chemistry and carbon compounds

- CO_2: carbon dioxide

- organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds
- simple or complex, usually complex
- nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates (all complex)
- most contain hydrogen
- if a compound only contains carbon & hydrogen, we call it a hydrocarbon
- carbon counts for the large diversity of molecules

- 4 elements: N O H C
- 2 others: P ?

- overall percentage carbon modules is very stable
- differences between species

- carbon is tetravalent (4 covalent bonds)
- can make very branched molecules

- methane, ethane, ethene(ethylene)
  methane 1 carbon
  ethane 2 carbons
  propane 3 carbons
  butane 4 carbons
  pentane 5 carbons
  octane 8 carbons

- -ane one bond between carbons
- -ene double bond between carbons
  butene 4 carbons

- carbon fixation, is photosynthesis, only done by producers, taking
  carbon out of atmosphere and putting it into matter

** valence / bonding capacity

HONC
1234

Sulfer, Phosphorous

** hydrocarbons

- non-polar
- length of the chain can vary

- hydrocarbons can be branched
- isobutane (2-methylpropane)

*** double bonds

- suffix ends with -ene
- 1-butene - double bond is between carbons 1 & 2
- 2-butene - double bond between 2 & 3

*** rings

- cyclohexane, 6 carbon ring
- benzene, 6 carbons, 3 with double bonds

*** fats

- very long hydrocarbon tail
- non-polar
- butter/oil - doesn't like to mix with water
- store a lot of energy

- fats store energy for animals
- plants like to store oils

** isomers

- same molecular formula (number & types of atoms), but have different
  structures
- butane & isobutane

- 3 kinds
- structural, sys-trans (geometric), and in-antimers

*** structural

- different in the covalent bonds
- pentane & 2-methylbutane
- same molecular formula: C_5 H_12
- different properties

- can also differ in the position of their double bond

*** cis-trans isomers

- cis isomer: the two xs are on the same side
- trans isomer: the two Xs on the opposite side

Cis:

  X       X
   \     /
    C = C
   /     \
  H       H

Trans:

  H       X
   \     /
    C = C
   /     \
  X       H

- Trans fats & cis fats; trans fats clog up our arteries


*** enantimer isomers

- mirror images
- asymetric carbon atom: has 4 different groups of atoms around it
- must have an asymetric carbon atom

- deinantimers: dextroinordinary, light to the right
- inantimers: l...., light to the left

- usually one antimer is biologically active, the other isn't
- the body will only recognize biologically active antimers
- D sugars
- L amino acids

- L & D dopa
- l dopa is biologically active

** form follows function

- molecular structure
- components

** functional groups

- the components most often present in reactions
- give personality (properties) to a molecule

- TODO memorize these functional groups

- these groups behave consistently from one molecule to another
- the number and arrangement of the group will give the molecule it's
  properties

- testosterone
- estradiol

Hydroxyl, Carbonyl, Carboxyl, ...

- first 6 are hydrophilic (they have an oxygen or a nitrogen or a sulfur
  atom)
- last is hydrophobic

*** Hydroxyl

  R - C - {O - H}
  R - C - {OH}

- OH group that's bonded to the carbon skeleton
- alcohol

*** Carbonyl

**** aldyhide

  R - C = O
      |
      H

- 2 members, C with double bonded O and single bonded H
- aldyhide
- formaldyhide
- propanal

**** keytone

- testosterone

*** Carboxyl

  R - C = O
      |
      O
      H

- carbocylic acid
- double bonded oxygen with a hydroxyl
- steal the electron
- COOH
- COO^- if an ion

*** Amino
