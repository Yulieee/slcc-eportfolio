# Salt Lake City Community College e-Portfolio

This is the core repository for all work done in courses through SLCC. In here you can find code samples, papers, and assignments related to the courses I have taken. For teacher evaluation this repo uses github pages. If you'd like to visit the raw code repository, it can be found [here](https://github.com/nrub/slcc-eportfolio)

## Courses

* [CSC 1030](cs-1030-002-Su12) - Connected Computing
* [English 2010](engl-2010-Su12-Argyle) - Intermediate Writing

## LaTeX and Org Files

All papers have been typeset using LaTeX in MLA format. You can download the rendered pdfs above. Org files are used by emacs org-mode, and are plaintext.

The MLA template for the typesetting was found [here](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mla-paper/) and was created by [Ryan Aycock](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~aycock/)

## Weasel Words, Passive Voice, & Lexical Illusions

[Matt Might](matt.might.net), an assistant professor of [the University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu), has provided several useful tools for improving writing and articles. All papers were run through his scripts found in [this post](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/) to improve their quality. These shell scripts may be found in this repository as well.
