## Questions

* How would you validate the information sent to you via a text message?.

    If you've initially traded phone number information in a physical conversation, you can often be relatively sure that a text is coming from the phone you used. You can't guarantee that the text was sent from the person who owns the phone number, since phones can be lost, stolen, or used without the owners permission. The only way to really know that the sender of a text message did in fact send a specific message is by asking them in person. That's the only way you can be sure they sent it, whether that person is telling the truth to the best of their ability or not is another story.

* How would you validate a $25.00 check in the mail?

    If you're able to cash the check you will receive the funds, however in the case of a falsified check or an account without the balance to cover the check, the money can be pulled from your account. Usually if after 2-3 weeks, if the funds haven't been reversed it is valid.

* How would you validate information about a death of a close person?

    Obituaries are one of the only ways to validate deaths. They can in theory be faked, though it's harder now then it has been in the past to do so. Since birth dates & death dates are vital information, an individual can look up state records to verify if someone has been legally declared dead.

* How would you validate information you received from an email?

    Similar to information recieved from a text, you may only really know by having a physical conversation with someone. Email accounts can easily be hacked, or stolen. The headers to an email can also be faked, however many modern email clients will treat emails with suspicious headers as spam. Sometimes tech savvy users will digitally sign & encrypt the contents of their email using a PGP certificate, or similar. If you've previously verified someones public encryption certificates, and you recieve a signed email message, you can be fairly confident that the email is valid. There still may be a chance their machine or digital signature were compromised, though it's going to be a bit more rare to have someone successfully forge an email with an encrypted signature.   

* How would you validate information from a local newspaper?

    Newspapers will validate information they print to the best of their ability. If it's a locally or nationally trusted paper you can be confident the information is valid. Accounting for human error, there is always a chance the team behind the newspaper can make a mistake or didn't validate the information they published. In most cases you can trust that a newspaper contains relatively valid information. There is always bias in publications, so understanding the viewpoints of your newspaper publishers is important to take into account, if you're looking for a balanced opinion on a topic. 

* How would you validate information from local TV NEWS?

    TV News stations are relatively trustworthy, similar to newspapers, however due to the desire for most news stations to have the a breaking subject first, they can easily jump the gun and be fooled. Also similar to a newspaper, a TV station may contain biased information, arguably more biased than a newspaper since media owners can more effectively control the opinion sent out in a live broadcast. Aside from traditional bias, if a news program is providing live coverage, chances are it's real.

* How would you validate information from a website?

    Trusting a website hinges mostly on trusting the organization that maintains or publishes to the website. As with any digital device information can be changed through man-in-the-middle attacks, or server infiltration at the source. Is the organization a school, government, or trusted corporation? If it's an individuals website, is the person an authority figure, or do they have a strong ethos? If you're able to verify the security of your own machine and connection, the likelihood of receiving valid information relies mostly on the source of the information and verifying that that source wasn't hijacked in any way.

* How would you validate information from a billboard?

    Since billboards are often used to promote commercial interests, most information should be received understanding that the parties involved in distributing that message have a financial interest in presenting the information in their favor. Companies want to sell their product so they will always portray their messages and "facts" in a way that promotes their product. Churches sell their religion, so they're going to portray messages that invite and coerce individuals to join in some method or through action. Businesses might present jobs within their company as the best, so they can attract new hires. Events can be promoted through billboards, and you can often be sure that the information on them is correct, though it's still an ad and may contain random marketing as well. Politicians and the organizations that run their campaign, are often likely to contain bias towards the candidate they support. There are cases where a municipality or government will use a billboard to provide a PSA or present similar information about a subject. These will likely be more official, and often can be verified through other sources or from the organization presenting them. All in all most billboards are ads, you probably shouldn't treat them as anything more than that.

* How would you validate information given to you during a class from an instructor?

    Instructors will, hopefully, do their best to present valid and factual information. Just like any individual, they may have biased opinions that can lead them to skew or alter information to fit their perspectives. They may also simply present dated information in a field that has evolved or matured beyond their initial understanding. In most cases you cannot fault a teacher for misinformation, but it does happen intentionally from time to time, like a kindergarten teacher who can't get into explaining where babies come from due to not wanting to offend parents. Most information can be trusted, but If a student wants to seriously verify something, they can seek out other authorities in the field or subject. A student may also find up-to-date refernece information using many different sources.

## What Reasons Would You Bypass Or Skip Proper Validation Noted Above?

In most cases we have grown innate guages that help us to judge information quickly. We can often quickly judge if their are controlling interests that would lead to invalid information. We also learn to trust individuals over time, as well as develop pattern recognition in the information that is regularly presented to us. When we recognize that information has financial or political bias behind it we tend to naturally disregard certain things. If a friend or trusted individual begins breaking from previously exzhibited view points or regular pattersn little alarms tend to go off in our head that make us double check our inquire. Sometimes plain lack of interest may lead us to skip validation as well. If every person in the world had to rigidly verify every piece of information they ever received, it would be likely that very little would ever get done.

## Reflective Writing

As we seek to validate and confirm the world around us it's easy to get locked into biased perspectives, or mistakenly bypass proper fact checking. We can only hope we don't receive misinformation that leads us to make a large mistake, since it happens to all of us. We all get lied to at some point, and we all lie. The only things we can do is work to better educate ourselves over time. Education and experience play the most important roles in information validation, so meeting people, moving and traveling, and always asking questions about the world around you is the best we can hope for. We can never be 100% confident, as sometimes even our own brains and bodies may lie to us, in the case of physical or mental conditions. Trust is a mysterious and fragile topic in a lot of ways, and learning to gain trust as well as present a trustful persona takes time.
