## Reflective Writing

I didn't like having to use macromedia flash. I didn't like the music that autoplays. I did like that you could turn off the music. I didn't like that you couldn't turn off the sound effects. I didn't like the use of the bottom row as the static cell, since attempting to input when a new row is being animated into the screen is not possible. I didn't like the scarcity of difference between convertion from binary to decimal, and decimal to binary. I didn't like the choice of colors. I don't think that removing the visible bit values as the level progressed affected output. Whatever, these are mostly moot points on the interface, so I'll quiet my rant.

I can't say I've ever had to actually do that much manual conversion of binary data in any profesional work, but I highly doubt being well versed and fast at converting is ever a hinderence, so it was probably a worthwhile activity.
