I didn't like having to use macromedia flash. I didn't like the music
that autoplays. I did like that you could turn off the music. I didn't
like that you couldn't turn off the sound effects. I didn't like the
use of the bottom row as the static cell, since attempting to input
when a new row is being animated into the screen is not possible. I
didn't like the scarcity of difference between convertion from binary
to decimal, and decimal to binary. I didn't like the choice of
colors. I don't think that removing the visible bit values as the
level progressed affected output. I didn't like score was based on a
screenshot, which is easily manipulated and shows no effort on the
part of the teacher to create or provide a lesson plan.
