## Reflective Writing

This was an enlightening conference. There's a whole lot that I don't know about copyright law, patents, intellectual property, and other legal issues related to software engineering and general ideas behind inventions. My consensus, be aware of the basics of this stuff, but lawyer up if you plan to go through any of this stuff. Also the lunch was mediocre, but hey, it was free.
