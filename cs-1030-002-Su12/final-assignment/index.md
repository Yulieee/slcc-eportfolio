Every day we use computers. It doesn't matter if we touch a keyboard, use a mouse, or even look at a computer directly our lives are being guided by processes, programs, and hardware situated around the globe. We have no choice in the matter, it's far too efficient and established to use these systems than to rely on human systems alone. Our finances are all stored in databases, we learn using connected networks on the Internet and the World Wide Web, and most of the machines we interact with day-to-day are run using computing systems. It's not something to worry about, but has simply become a matter of fact. Understanding how computing systems work and the technologies that make up these systems can provide us with the right fundamentals to leverage their power in our own personal and profesional lives. However, we must remain concerned about both the postives and the negatives that are attached to living in a society that is more connected than ever before.
