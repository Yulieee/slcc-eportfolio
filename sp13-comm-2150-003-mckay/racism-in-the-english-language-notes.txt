use in the general public, many more subtle bigotrous words and
colloquialisms are still very much in use, with noted examples into the
1970's and even in modern day media.

** color symbolism

How the words and definitions around the colors white and black
promote subtle racism, and segragated understanding.

- white: positive, good guys
- black: negative, bad guys

- captain scarlet; colonel white & captain black, spectrum vs, mysterons

- blonde ad: "Whey you go blonde go all the way," "Isn't this how, in
  the back of your mind, you always wanted to look? All wide-eyed and
  silky blonde down to there, and innocent?"

- tennis: evonne coolagong (dusky), chris every (fair young girl)
  
- '"rightness of whiteness," in U.S. culture affects children before
  the age of four, providing white youngsters with a false sense of
  superiority and encouraging self-hatred among third world
  youngsters.'
  
** ethnocentrism or from a white perspective

- slave/master
  -- PE NOTE computers and software systems use slave & master rampantly to
  denote controlling and coordinating relationships between servers,
  applications, and hardware. Slave/master harddrives (RAID, and
  multi-drive setups); (worker|minion|slave)/master app servers
  (saltstack, puppet, chef); slave/master databases (replications &
  backups).
  
- the slave/master relationship forgives atrocities against the
  african american people (rape is used as an example)
  
- the term slave dehumanizes, and changes the meaning. "The African
  People"

** passive tense

- active/passive voice
  
- "slaves were brought to America" vs. "America brought slaves"
  -- ignoring how much american markets prospered thanks to the active
  slave trade & plentiful field workers.
  
- "the continental railroad was built" vs. "Chinese laborers built the
  continental railroad"
  
- "Mr. Jefferson designed these doors..." vs. "the doors were
  installed in 1809"
  -- emphasizing the white designer skills over the skill & work
  involved in building and installing them.
  
** politics and terminology

- "culturally deprived," "economically disadvantaged,"
  "underdeveloped"
  -- hypocritical due to the monoculture american white children grow
  up in.
  
- "underdeveloped" nations :: "over-exploited" nations
- words/phrases that blame the victim
- "non-white," "minority," "third-world"

** loaded words & native americans

- Columnbus discovered a continent already inhabited by millions of
  human beings?
- victory & massacre used to describe european battles with native
  americans.
- euro-american conquest described not as invasion, but as defending
  against indian attacks

  with european countries

  African people.

  exploited and enslaved
- How dark refers back to the color symbolism previously noted.
- The negative terminology of pagan worship; Heathen

** qualifying adjectives

- stating that one memeber is intelligent can have different meanings
  when placed in a racial context. As though one group isn't normally
  intelligent, so by stating it you make an example of the one.
