* microscopy

* measurements

meter = m
micro meter = m / 1000 = mm
nano meter = mm / 1000 = um
fempto meter = um / 1000 = fm

1 mL = 1cc = 1g
1 uL = 1mg

density = specific gravity

# TODO lookup density by water

* microscopes

simple microscope
compound microscope

ocular lense, objective lense

machine that cuts slices of a polymer medium with tissue sample in it

---

resolution: ability to distinguish between 2 points

* cells

prokaryotes - no membrane bound organelles
eukaryotes -

difference between animal cells & plant cells

plant cells - cellulose, cell wall

prokaryotes have a plasma membrane seperated by a cell wall, but don't
have well-defined nucleai

---

cyanobacteria (prokaryote)
- thylakoids (pseudo membrane) surround the clorophyl membranes in cyanobacteria
- thyla-: (Vulcan) brother, friend, or lover

epi-: to look from above

---

milk --> lactobacillus = yogurt

nucleus --> houses DNA
phospholipid bilayer -> membrane that holds it all together

mitochondria: organelle, ATP synthesis, oxidative respiration

golgi complex: used for packaging compounds made within the cell

ribosomes: protein synthesis

lysosomes: organelles that are designed to neutralize harmful byproducts
