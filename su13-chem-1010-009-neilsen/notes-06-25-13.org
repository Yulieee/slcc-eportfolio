* ch 5: nomenclature

- octet rule
- cations & anions

** naming molecules

- number of shared electrons helps decide the suffix
  -- ionic bonds

- 1 with 1, -ine
  -- LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl
- 2 with 2, -ide
  -- MgO, MgS, CaO, CaS
  -- also 1 with 2; Li_2O
  -- or; MgF_2, MgCl_2

- poly atomic ions
- hydrogen atoms become hydrogen ions

- name the cation, then the anion

- Fe(II) = Fe^{2+}
- Fe(III) = Fe^{3+}

- CrCl_3

** more notes

- this class moves pretty slow, not worth too many notes

** TODO homework
