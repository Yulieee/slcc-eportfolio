** phases of matter

- gas, liquid, solid

*** solid
    - particles that are frozen in place
    - definite shape

*** liquid
    - moving particles, more dynamic
    - will take the shape of it's container, but will not expand

*** gas
    - expands to take the shape of it's container
    - particles are very far apart

*** boiling point / melting point
     - every molecule has a boiling & melting point
     - melting: the transition from solid to liquid
     - boiling: the transition from liquid to gas
     - temperature & pressure; mostly related on temperature as
       oftentimes in a natural system pressure will remain the same

PV = nRT

Where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is temperature, and the
other variables are never explained by this shitty teacher, so they'll
have to be referenced from the book or elsewhere

** physical & chemical changes
  - change between states: physical changes
    -- changes that do not change the chemical composition of matter
    -- physical changes != chemical changes, for all types of changes
  - chemical changes: changes in the chemical composition of a substance(s)

*Examples*
- boiling point                                    -> physical change
- diamond is very hard                             -> physical property
- sugar ferments to form alcohol                   -> chemical change
- metal wire conducts an electric current          -> physical property
- galium melts in your hand                        -> physical property
- platinum does not react with oxygen at room temp -> chemical
- white piece of paper                             -> physical property
- copper turning green                             -> chemical change
- iron metal is melted -> physical change
- iron combines with oxygen to form rust -> chemical reaction
- rock broken into small pieces -> physical change
- milk turns sour -> chemical change

** mixtures / substance
- mixtures combined of more than one elements or molecules
- pure substance: element (H, O), compound (H_2O)

*** mixtures
1. homogeneous: same throughout
2. heterogeneous: regions that are different

**** homgeneous
- can use physical changes to seperate pure substances from a
  homogeneous mixture
- seperating salt from salt water
  -- distillation

**** heterogeneous
- sand in water

**** matter tree

matter -> mixtures
       -> pure substances

pure substances -> compounds
                -> elements (chapter 4)
                -> requires chemical changes to split compounds

mixtures -> homogeneous
         -> heterogeneous
         -> can be seperated based on physical properties
