 * Recursive Binary Search
 *
 * Modify Fig. 19.4 to use recursive method recursiveBinary-
 * Search to perform a binary search of the array. The method should receive the search key, starting
 * index and ending index as arguments. If the search key is found, return its index in the array. If the
 * search key is not found, return â€“1.
