## Group Projects

We implemented a [school schedule easiness predictor](http://schedule-easiness-predictor.herokuapp.com) using a corpus of publically available class ratings.

We used web scraping to collect a set of class reviews that contained information pertaining to the easiness of a specific course. By comparing these reviews and implementing the usage of machine learning classifiers we are able to predict with some accuracy how difficult a future class and schedule will be.

How we built this project:

* [Keynote Slides](#TODO)
* [Main Project Repository](#TODO)
* [Running Development Site](#TODO)
* [Classifier Results & Output](#TODO)
