Anish Kapoor is an Indian born british sculptor, who was born in Mumbai, though he has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s where he went to study art. He attended the Hornsey College of Art as well as the Chelsea School of Art and Design, and has since then been recognized for a number of public works including works such as the Cloud Gate (pictured) in Millennium Park, Chicago; the Sky Mirror in at Rockefeller Center, New York; and the ArcelorMittal Orbit created London Olympic games of 2012. Each of these are notable, and large, metal sculptures.

Though the mentioned sculptures are all metal, Anish became known became known in the 1980s for using simple stone materials together for his artwork, and began sculpting stone in the late 1980s. His early works we're distinguished for their tendency to disappear, transition away, or distort the surrounding space. More recently, since 1995, he's worked with highly reflective polished stainless steel surfaces, and a number of his works have exhibited the steels mirror like effect. Some of his non-metal works exhibit bright pigments favoring reds, and other colors.

Kapoor has been recognized for his many unique sculptures and installations. He's was the first Guest Artistic Director of the Brighton Festival in 2009, has become the first living artist to have had a solo exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, and has created a large number of public commissions.

As he tends to favor large ambitious projects he has had many works that border somewhere between pure artistic installations and architecture. Though he doesn't consider himself an architect, or any of his works purely architecture he has worked on a handful of architectural installations including the Ark Nova, Orbit, Temenos, two subway stations in Naples, Tarantara, among others. He has worked extensively with both architects and engineers to create many of these pieces.

Kapoor's work is large, publicly evoking, and built to feel different or warped. He has made a long career of persistent creation and continual evolution of his ideas and work. Given what he has achieved to date, he is very likely to continue making notable contributions to the artistic space of sculpture, large installations, among other things.
