Knowing how to touch type should be a pre-requisite. I see little
reason why it matters in a computer science course. Someones typing
speed doesn't give an advantage to a programmer in the same way it
might a writer. Programming rarely involves typing anywhere near
maximum wpm or efficiency, a peck-typer can be as productive as a
touch-typer.

typingtest.com looks and feels outdated, frankly it is
outdated. Having to use flash player feels bulky, and they have an
ugly jsp extension on their pages. Why do I at all care about
Baseball?
