In the Christian canon references to Jesus Christ as the Messiah
include his virgin birth from Mary, the references to family
descendance of the throne of David and the house of Jacob, they
include the prophecies that many of the relatives had relating to
Christ's noble birth, as well the stories of resurrection and miracles
which Christ performed.

Christ was written as a very holy and wise person, who always taught
his followers the right path over the traditions and assumptions which
they had practiced for quite some time.

His life is described as the fulfillment of the old law which was
brought forth by Moses in the Old Testament. He offered a newer
standard that the people should follow, which represents a part of his
messianic calling.

% What did some people accept that he was & others did not?
