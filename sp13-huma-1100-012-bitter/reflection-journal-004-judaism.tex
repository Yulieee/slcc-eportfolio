%% - What is this god like?

Vengeful, spiteful, controlling, emotional, and strict. The rules are
explicit, and with severe consequences. This God makes himself known,
and is highly respected. Even so much in that his name is not fully
represented in text or speach out of respect. He speaks to the people,
unlike other religions or gods.

In another sense he's concerned, loving, and understanding of his
people. Promising blessings and benefits for following his word. He
values his followers and hopes they grow, and share the story amongst
themselves and oth#ers.

He tests his people to see if they truly believe in him, or ensure
loyalty. He does it to teach his people, and confirm their own
feelings of him.
