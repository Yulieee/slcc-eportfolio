* *Number of online accounts:* At least 193, with quite a few unaccounted for.
* *Number of accounts with the same password:* At least 28 of the lower security accounts (ok some of them are pretty important) have a simple generic password that I default too. Beyond the default there is little to know repetition of passwords.

## Reflective Writing

I've been annoyed by the whole digital identity thing for a while now. For some asanine reason every site just has to enforce a different password and username policy, there is no standard. It's impossible to securely differentiate your passwords without storing them in a central database for reference. There is the theoretical exception of those geniuses who have a perfect memory or a perfect password algorithm, but in practice we all need to store our list of accounts somewhere. 

Facebook connect, Twitter, Google, and thousands of others all provide oAuth and OpenID. This is an attempt at a solution, and centralizing your authentication mechanism through one account is convenient, but it provides a potential single point of ultimate failure, which no security profesional in their right mind can accept without sweating profusely.

When it comes down to it we don't yet have any great way to manage our digital identities, and given the largely anonymous nature of the internet, I almost hope we don't ever. I would rather maintain the anonymous possibility, and deal with managing my own accounts, than be stuck with a universal digital identity and never having a way to anonymously login every once in a while.
