## Reflective Writing

I already had some knowledge on who Tim Berners-Lee was, but it was very vague. Understanding how a perfect set of situations and technological development led to the perfect opportunity for this man to create something like the web is absurdly interesting. The web, and all the technologies that it's built upon are very elegant in their design, and it's important to note this, because a lot of the content and sites on the web are far from elegant. Even some of the more difficult software problems I've tackled before are basic compared to the structure and design of the core web. I'm terribly impressed by the openness, simplicity, and beneficial impact that the internet and widescale web adoption has.

Everyone, and I mean everyone, on the earth is in many ways affected by what the web has done. Cultures are consumed by it. Communications have reached a peer-to-peer level that we had never before realized was possible. We can now carry around volumes of human knowledge in our pocket thanks to the interconnected nature of the web and wireless/mobile networking.

As a software engineer who primarily works with web technologies, Lee is one of the titans I build all my work on. I will most likely literally be playing in Sir Lee's sandbox all of my life. Now, tell me that doesn't rightly deserve knighthood.
