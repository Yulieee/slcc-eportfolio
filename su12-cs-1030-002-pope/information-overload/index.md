## Reflective Writing

Um.. I've always kept good logs of my computing activities. I've got a year or two of them in backups. I've kept them pretty much ever since I discovered [Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org/) for [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I'd venture to say that a lot of the logs represented in this 48 hour period is a bit more than what actually took place, however I am an above average consumer of digital media and the internet in general. This particular sample was a highly stressful set of days where I was working against a few deadlines, all the same I know some people who might declare this activity unhealthy. They say that what gets measured, gets managed, but that doesn't always mean you reduce that which you measure. Once again, I can't state it strongly enough this past 48 hours represent more of an outlier in my schedule than most 2-day samplings.

I think some of the interesting points of my particular case, would be that the Internet is integrated into damn near everything I do. I eschew traditional media in almost every possible way. I run tv, movies, music, news, images, and almost all communications through the internet. I rarely use the telephone other than texting and short conversations, prefering either methods of communication I can track better or face-to-face conversations. We are so connected already, it will be interesting to see how much more we go in the future.
